# 🧠 Reasoning Gym – Multi-Agent Study & Exam Coach

> **Track(s):**  
> 🟦 Track 1 – Reasoning Systems (UofT AI)  
> 🟩 General Track – Open Innovation  

Reasoning Gym is a **multi-agent study coach** powered by Claude that trains students to *think* through hard problems instead of just handing them the answer.

Students can:

- Break down tough questions into smaller steps  
- Get guided, Socratic help instead of full solutions  
- Receive structured feedback on their own work  
- Generate realistic study plans for upcoming exams  

This project was built for the **Anthropic AI Hackathon @ UofT** (Nov 1–23, 2025).

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Guided Problem Solving (Socratic Coach)

Paste a problem (math / CS / econ / theory / etc.) and Reasoning Gym will:

- **Decompose** it into a sequence of reasoning steps  
- Guide you through each step with questions and hints  
- Adapt to your answers (gives more hints if you’re stuck)  
- Only reveals the full solution outline after sufficient effort

> Goal: build *your* reasoning muscles, not replace them.

---

### 2. Solution Critique (TA-Style Feedback)

Paste the **problem** and your **attempted solution**.

The system:

- Checks for **logical gaps** and unjustified steps  
- Highlights **missing edge cases** or incorrect assumptions  
- Rewrites your solution in plain language so you can see if it matches what you meant  
- Provides structured feedback: “What you did well / What to improve”

### 3. Study Planner for Courses & Exams

Give Reasoning Gym:

- Course name (e.g. “CSC458 – Computer Networks”)  
- Topics or a rough syllabus  
- Exam date & weekly study hours  

It will:

- Build a **realistic day-by-day study plan**  
- Emphasize high-value topics and spaced review  
- Generate **checkpoint questions** for each topic so you can self-test

## 🧩 Multi-Agent Design

Internally, Reasoning Gym uses **specialized Claude “agents”** implemented as separate prompt profiles:

- 🧩 **Decomposer Agent** – breaks problems into steps & required concepts  
- 🗣️ **Socratic Coach Agent** – interacts with the student step-by-step  
- 🔍 **Critic / Verifier Agent** – evaluates solutions and explains issues  
- 📅 **Planner Agent** – turns topics + constraints into a study schedule  
- (Optional) 🧠 **Misconception Tracker** – surfaces recurring patterns of mistakes

The frontend orchestrates these agents via a simple backend API, so each mode has a clear contract (inputs / outputs) but shares context when needed.

## 🛡️ Ethics & Academic Integrity

Reasoning Gym is explicitly designed to **support learning**, not cheating.

We implement several guardrails:

- **No direct full solution by default** – the coach uses hints and questions first  
- **“Show solution” is gated** – only appears after multiple attempts or user confirmation  
- Clear **disclaimer**: do not paste take-home exams; use for practice & understanding  
- Prompts encourage **reflection**: after solving, students are asked what they learned and what to do differently next time

This aligns with the hackathon’s focus on **safe, human-centered AI** and responsible model use.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React + TypeScript), Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes / Node.js  
- **LLM:** Anthropic Claude API  
- **Storage (optional):** SQLite / Supabase / PostgreSQL (for saving sessions & history)

> You can swap in your own stack; the core idea is agent-like prompt separation.
